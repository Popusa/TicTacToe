This is the TicTacToe project that I am making as part of the The Odin Project Curriculum.

It is the second project in the design patterns section that will teach me how to write organized and clean code.

Also, the main objective of the project is to learn how to use factories and the module pattern, which is going to be interesting!

The game has four modes: 2-player, normal CPU, hard CPU, and unbeatable CPU.

2-player is the classic tictactoe game with two players playing it together.

the CPU modes however, will be comprised of three difficulties:

First: a normal difficulty where a CPU will play random moves every turn.

Second: a hard difficulty where a CPU will attempt to win at every turn it plays However, it has a glaring weakness which is that it cannot defend itself when it is about to lose.

Third: An unbeatable CPU made using the minimax algorithm that cannot lose no matter what and always knows the best (maximizing) position to play everytime. 

This project will teach me more and more about web development and algorithms and I am very excited to take another step forward in my web development journey.
