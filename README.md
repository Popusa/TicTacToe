This is the TicTacToe project that I am making as part of the The Odin Project Curriculum.

It is the second in the design patterns section that will teach me how to write organized and clean code.

Also, the main objective of the project is to learn how to use factories and the module pattern, which is going to be interesting!

The game has two modes: 2-player and CPU.

2-player is the classic tictactoe game with two players playing it together.

CPU mode however, will be comprised of two difficulties:

First: an easy difficulty where a moderately smart CPU will attempt to win.

Second: An unbeatable CPU made using the minimax algorithm that cannot lose no matter what. 

This project will teach me more and more about web development and I am very excited to take another step forward in my web development journey.

The link for the live version: will put here when I finish the project.
