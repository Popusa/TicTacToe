<h3>Description</h3>
This is the TicTacToe project that I am making as part of the The Odin Project Curriculum.

The project is using HTML/CSS/Vanilla JS, as well as the Web Storage API that allows for some data storage on the user device.

It is the second project in the design patterns section that will teach me how to write organized and clean code.
Also, the main objective of the project is to learn how to use the factory pattern, which is going to be interesting!
In the project, you can choose between different AI gamemodes or a player versus player gamemode, and change you or your opponent's names.
There is a choice for playing against an unbeatable AI, that was implemented using the Minimax Algorithm. It cannot lose, only win or draw.

<h3> Features </h3>
- Clean Code
- Factory Pattern
- Responsive web design

The game has four modes: 

1. Two-player,
2. Normal CPU,
3. Hard CPU,
4. Unbeatable CPU.

2-player is the classic tictactoe game with two players playing it together.

the CPU modes however, will be comprised of three difficulties:

### Normal:
a normal difficulty where a CPU will play random moves every turn.

### Hard:
a hard difficulty where a CPU will attempt to win at every turn it plays after the first two moves. However, it has a glaring weakness which is that it cannot defend itself when it is about to lose and it is limited to random moves at the first two moves.

### Unbeatable:
An unbeatable CPU made using the minimax algorithm that cannot lose no matter what and always knows the best (maximizing) position to play everytime.
